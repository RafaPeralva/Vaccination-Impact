# Vaccination-Impact

### Description

***
As our lives have been impacted by the global pandemic that began in 2020, we thought that there couldn't
have been a better data to analyze and put into pratice the skills we learned in our Database Management class (CS 435) during the semester of spring of 2021 at Hunter College.
We used the data from `https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data` as well as performing the normalization steps required to make our data represanttions more effective and useful.
